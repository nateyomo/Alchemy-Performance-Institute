# How to study ALS 
To study ALS, I would begin with a 5 minute video to get a quick overview and lay the mental foundation for the future topics such as: [Khan academy ALS video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKDET9t8VTI).

The textbooks I recommend for further research or reference is:

- (PT Specific) Physical rehabilitation - O'Sullivan @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
- Neuromuscular disorders by Amato @amatoNeuromuscularDisorders2016
- Umphred's neurological rehabilitation @lazaroUmphredNeurologicalRehabilitation2019
- Continuum - AAN @goutmanDiagnosisClinicalManagement2017

Lastly, I would then recommend going into true evidence based practice by using scientific articles to find up to date information on the topic.

# introduction

What does "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis" even mean?

- a --> no
- myo --> muscle
- Trophic --> Nourishment
Thus Amyotrophic means "no muscle nourishment"

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), AKA Lou Gehrigâ€™s disease, is the most common and devastatingly fatal motor neuron disease (MND) among adults @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. ALS is characterized by the degeneration and loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and brain, resulting in UMN and LMN clinical signs and symptoms @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. Recently, ALS is being recategorized as a multisystem disorder/syndrome with variable pathological involvement of extra-motor networks and connections, in addition to the LMNs and UMNs @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019

# Epidemiology

## Age
ALS can occur at any age but onset generally occurs in the mid-to-late 50s @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.

## Gender
Most studies have found that the disease affects men slightly more than women, with an approximate ratio of 1.7:1. After age 65, the gender difference decreases @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.

## Family History
About 5% to 10% of individuals have a family history of ALS (familial ALS, [FALS]) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.
Familial ALS is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.

Most cases of FALS are autosomal dominant @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. Regardless, recessive and X-linked forms have been described @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. For example, the rare juvenileonset ALS is reported to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 

### FALS Categorization
FALS is categorized by mode of inheritance and further subcategorized by specific gene or chromosomal locus@osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 

The very large majority of adult individuals with ALS have no family history of the disease (sporadic ALS) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.

A very small percentage of individuals with sporadic ALS do have a mutation in SOD1
:::

Over 20 chromosomal regions and a number of identified genes have been linked to ALS. 20% of hereditary ALS cases are attributed to one of 100+ mutations in [superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)](../../Genetics and genomics/SOD1 superoxide dismutase 1.qmd) @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 
~50% of individuals with an SOD1 ALS variant are symptomatic by 46yrs, and 90% are symptomatic by 70 years of age @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 

## Onset

- ~70% to 80% of individuals develop limb-onset ALS, with initial involvement in the extremities @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 
- 20% to 30% develop bulbar-onset ALS, with initial involvement in the bulbar muscles @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019. 
- Bulbar-onset ALS is more common in middle-aged women, and initial symptoms may include difficulty speaking, chewing, or swallowing @osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019
