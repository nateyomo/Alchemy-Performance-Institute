title: Neurotrophic Hormone Deficiency Theory
---


# Overview
{{< meta title >}} was originally proposed by Appel et al., (1981) and is a modification to the Accelerated Aging Theory. This theory suggests that accelerated aging to particular neural areas is due to the presence of certain extrinsic factors @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981. The areas with these extrinsic factors experiencing accelerated aging (Degeneration) and are the  common underlying cause of [ALS]({{< var ref-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.path >}}), Parkinsonism, and Alzheimer's Disease.


# Commonalities of ALS, PD, and AD 
To understand this theory, one must first understand the overlapping concepts of each of these diseases. 

- All 3 diseases have changes in presynpatic neuronal input with secondary alterations of the target tissue @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- All 3 diseases sporadically occur later in life and the incidence increases with age @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- All 3  diseases have a familial form that occurs in 5-10% of patients @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- Heavy metal intoxication is a secondary cause of these diseases @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981


## Presynaptic neuron changes + Target tissue alterations

- [ALS]({{< var ref-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis.path >}}) has changes in Betz cells, CN motor neurons, and anterior horn cells @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- PD includes changes in Substantia nigra neurons @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- Alzheimer's disease includes changes in the cholinergic input from nucleus basalis and septal neurons to cortex and hippocampus @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981

## Secondary Heavy Metal Onset 
- ALS: Lead @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- PD: Manganese @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
- Alzheimer's Disease: Aluminum (evidence is weak) @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981

# Accelerated Aging Theory
The Neurotrophic Hormone Deficiency Theory adds onto the accelerated aging theory.
The accelerated aging theory refers to the idea that the relevant neural areas are experiencing accelerated aging, and therefore and degenerating faster @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981. 

## Advantages of the theory

1. This theory explains why external causes such as viral nor abnormal factors have yet to be discovered for these 3 diseases.
1. This theory helps to explain why there is a prevailing and consistent genetic incidence of ALS, PD, AD @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
1. Accelerated aging explains why disease incidence worsens with age @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981
1. Lastly, this theory explains why external toxic factors such as heavy metal toxicity, trauma, viruses, infections, and vascular disease may increase the progression of these diseases

## Disadvantages

- It should be noted that this theory does not provide specific insight as to the selective vulnerability of these neuronal networks @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981.
- This theory does not offer meaningful and potentially useful therapeutic approahes to ALS, PD, or dementia/AD @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981.

# Mechanism
Neurotrophic Hormone Deficiency Theory adds to the accelerated aging idea by suggesting that the areas that undergo accelerated aging is based on intrinsic neuronal properties @appelUnifyingHypothesisCause1981.
