Familial ALS is phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous1.\nMost cases of FALS are autosomal dominant1. Regardless, recessive and X-linked forms have been described1. For example, the rare juvenileonset ALS is reported to be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern1.\n\n3.3.1 FALS Categorization\nFALS is categorized by mode of inheritance and further subcategorized by specific gene or chromosomal locus@osullivanPhysicalRehabilitation2019.\nThe very large majority of adult individuals with ALS have no family history of the disease (sporadic ALS)1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA very small percentage of individuals with sporadic ALS do have a mutation in SOD1\n\n\nOver 20 chromosomal regions and a number of identified genes have been linked to ALS. 20% of hereditary ALS cases are attributed to one of 100+ mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)1. ~50% of individuals with an SOD1 ALS variant are symptomatic by 46yrs, and 90% are symptomatic by 70 years of age1."

SOD1, a gene on chromosome 21, encodes CuZnSOD. Genetic studies of individuals with adult-onset FALS have determined that about 20% of these individuals have mutations in SOD1; however, the primary gene defect is unknown. When the SOD enzyme activity is decreased, as has been observed in individuals with FALS with SOD1 mutations, free radicals may accumulate causing damage"
